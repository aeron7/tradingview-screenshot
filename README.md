## Overview

This Python script automates the process of capturing screenshots from TradingView charts and converting TradingView chart links into direct image URLs for sharing. It's a useful tool for traders and analysts who want to streamline the process of capturing and sharing TradingView chart images.

#Setup

## Get your Tradingview Public Link

- Access your chart settings on TradingView.
- Change the sharing settings for your chart to "Public."
- Copy the chart's public link.
- Paste the copied chart link inside the tview_ss.py.py script.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Selenium library
- Chrome WebDriver
- xclip (for Linux systems)

You can install Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

To download Chrome WebDriver, visit ChromeDriver Downloads.

To install xclip, you can use the package manager specific to your Linux distribution.
Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xclip
```

Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tradingview-screenshot-capture.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd tradingview-screenshot-capture
```

Run the script, providing the desired TradingView symbol as an argument (default is "NONE"):

```bash
python capture_tradingview_screenshot.py
```

Wait for the script to execute. It will capture the TradingView chart screenshot and provide you with a direct image URL.

You can also check the locally saved screenshot as "m7azfyek.png" in the main directory.

Example Output

```ruby
Chart is ready for capture
https://www.tradingview.com/x/m7azfyek/
Chart Link: https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/m/m7azfyek.png
```

## Tkinter Version of Clipboard

There is another version of the program which is saved as `tview_tkinter.py`. It uses `tkinter` instead of `xclip`.

Unfortunately, both of the methods do not work using the Chrome headless version.

## Headless Version

A third version of the script, `tview_headless.py`, has been added. This version is specifically designed to work with a headless Chrome browser, allowing screenshots to be captured without opening a visible browser window. This is useful for server-side execution or automated workflows.
